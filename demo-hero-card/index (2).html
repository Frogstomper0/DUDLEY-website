            Demo of the 3D hover card for the Dudley Magpies website. This is a standalone preview so you can tweak the look and feel before dropping it into the real site.
          </p>
          <p>
            On desktop, hover the card on the right: it tilts back in 3D, and the character image pops out towards you with a strong drop shadow. This is pure HTML + CSS, no JavaScript required.
